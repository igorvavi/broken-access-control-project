        <p>
            Imagine a regular user inspecting how admin features work and guessing there might be
            hidden routes behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <p>
            After some experimentation (URL manipulation, brute-forcing, or using tools like Burp Suite),
            the user discovers a hidden endpoint:
        </p>

        <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border"><code>GET /adminify_me_plz</code></pre>

        <div class="alert alert-warning mt-3">
            🚨 This route should only be accessible to administrators, but currently lacks any access control.
        </div>

        <p>
            As a result, any logged-in user can promote themselves to admin by visiting that endpoint directly.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
            Try simulating the exploit by pasting this in the address bar:
        </p>

        <pre class="bg-dark text-white p-2 rounded"><code>http://127.0.0.1:5000/adminify_me_plz</code></pre>

        <p class="text-muted mt-2">⚠️ This is how many real-world attacks begin — simple access control oversights.</p>
